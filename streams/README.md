Track specific contracts and on-chain events with ease. Simply input the contracts you're interested in, add your ABI, and setup custom data filter on topics and metadata to receive the events, addresses, interactions, and internal transactions you need.

### How to Install?

Using the Firebase CLI:

**Step 1**: Add the extension to your project: `firebase ext:install moralis/moralis-streams --local --project=<PROJECT_ID_OR_ALIAS>`

**Step 2** ðŸš¨: Add **MANDATORY** security rules to the Firestore configuration (`firestore.rules`). This step is very important, because this extension adds new documents to specific collections bases on your subscribed streams. These collections cannot be modified by external users. To achieve that we need to set specific permissions.

```
rules_version = '2';

service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /moralis/{collectionType}/{collectionName}/{id} {
      allow read;
      allow write: if false;
    }
  }
}
```

Before deploying your project, be sure that you set permissions correctly. You may use for that the [Rules Playground](https://firebase.google.com/docs/rules/simulator). Go to: `Firebase Console` > `Your Project` > `Firestore Database` > `Rules` > `Edit Rules` and click the `Rules Playground` tab.

**Step 3 (Optional)**: Test this extension locally: `firebase emulators:start`

**Step 4**: Deploy this extension: `firebase deploy --only extensions --project=<PROJECT_ID_OR_ALIAS>`

## How do I setup a stream? 

Setup Moralis Stream using:
* [Moralis SDK - Documentation](https://docs.moralis.io/streams-api/evm/using-node-js-sdk)
* [No-code solution - Documentation](https://docs.moralis.io/streams-api/evm/using-webui)

## Webhook URL of Deployed Dapp

Go to: `Firebase Console` > `Build` > `Functions` and find a function called `ext-moralis-streams-webhook`. The URL should have the following format:

```
https://<location>-<project_id>.cloudfunctions.net/ext-moralis-streams-webhook
```

Check [our documentation](https://docs.moralis.io/streams-api/evm/integrations/firebase#webhook-url-of-deployed-dapp).

## Handling Streams by Cloud Functions 

For cloud functions, we need to create functions that are called when any item in the collection is changed. For that, we will use the `onWrite` trigger:

```ts
import * as functions from "firebase-functions";

const collectionName = "LoremIpsum";

export const onItemWrite = functions.firestore
  .document(`moralis/txs/${collectionName}/{id}`)
  .onWrite(async (change) => {
    const transaction = change.after.data();

    if (transaction && transaction.confirmed) {
      doSomeOperation(/* ... */);
    }
  });
```

Check [our documentation](https://docs.moralis.io/streams-api/evm/integrations/firebase#handling-streams).

## Handling Streams on the Frontend

For the frontend dapp, we will use the `onSnapshot` method:

```ts
const db = firebase.firestore();
const collectionName = "LoremIpsum";

db.collection(`moralis/txs/${collectionName}`).onSnapshot((change) => {
  doSomeOperation(change.docs);
});
```
